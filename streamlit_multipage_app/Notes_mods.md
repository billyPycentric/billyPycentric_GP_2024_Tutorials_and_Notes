# The Second Coming Of Multi-Page Application  
There are Two Methods(**st.nav and Pages/**) and The Most prefered one is the ***(st.Page and st.navigation)*** because they offer an option to fully customize your application     
## st.Pages & st.navigation   
1. Have an entry_point file -> combines all of your application , so this is where you declare or put the s.navigation command on   

## Pages/dir    
1. also have a navigaton but now with a dir in the root folder of the project(folder must me in the same folder entrypoint file is in)   
~~~

~~~   
you can use numerical prefixes  for ordering the pages
